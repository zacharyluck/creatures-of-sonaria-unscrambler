# creatures-of-sonaria-unscrambler
C++ based text unscrambler, uses a custom dictionary in `names.txt`, probably a horrible runtime.

## How to use:

1. Download COSHACK.zip and extract the Debug folder inside it somewhere

2. Go into your extracted Debug folder and run COSHACK.exe

3. A command prompt window will open and prompt you for some scrambled text, just enter in a scrambled name from a prompt in Creatures of Sonaria and press enter.

Happy present hunting!
